# Algorithm-Performance-Project
The purpose of this project is to assess the performance of KNN, logistic regression, and random forests by replicating the conditions of the Caruana paper on a much smaller scale. This project uses three of the UCI datasets cited in the paper known as the adult dataset, cover type dataset, and letter recognition dataset.
